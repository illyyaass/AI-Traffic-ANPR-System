# 🚗 AI Traffic & ANPR Monitoring System

An advanced Computer Vision project that performs real-time **Vehicle Counting** and **Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR)**. Built with Python, YOLOv8, and EasyOCR, featuring a modern Dark Mode Dashboard.

## 🌟 Key Features

- **👀 Real-Time Vehicle Detection:** Accurately detects Cars, Trucks, Buses, and Motorcycles using `YOLOv8`.
- **🔢 Aggressive License Plate Recognition:** Uses `EasyOCR` with advanced image preprocessing (thresholding, zooming) to force-read plates even in low resolution.
- **📊 Traffic Counting:** Automated logic to count vehicles exiting the frame (OUT Counting).
- **🖥️ Professional Dashboard:** A custom GUI built with `Tkinter`, featuring:
  - Live Video Feed with Bounding Boxes.
  - Real-time "OUT" Counter.
  - Live Activity Log (ID | Type | Plate Number).
- **📂 Data Logging:** Automatically saves all detections to `traffic_data_out.csv` with timestamps.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **Ultralytics YOLOv8** (Object Detection)
- **EasyOCR** (Text Recognition)
- **OpenCV** (Image Processing)
- **Supervision** (Tracking & Counting Logic)
- **Tkinter** (Graphical User Interface)
